# Modern Portfolio Website

This is my updated portfolio as my other one was not as modern and did not showcase my skills as effectively as this one. 

In this you will find my Frontend, Backend, Fullstack and Blockchain(solidity) projects. This is an ongoing development as I learn new skills and make new projects.

I used vue because it allowed me to compartmentalize my work into small reusable components. 

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

pnpm install
```
